                -Some of the main features I used for the form page of my website were input boxes and placeholders, option buttons for cities and also action link for the POST method. 
                With some specific requirement, such as case sensetive and numbers only, etc., which one of them had an example of 
                what type of input is expected from the user. The form required the user to enter all the information with the required details. 
                if the field is left blank, the user would not be allowed to submit the form and the user will face an error to complete all the required information. 
                it's fields.
               <br> <br>
                -to see if the forms were working, I put myself as the user of the website and went through all the necessary steps.
                while filling in the form as a user, at some point I found some bugs about the requirements of certain cities, but eventually I fixed it.
                and also to test for bugs, I did all the things that the user was not allowed to do to see if the user is still able to submit the form.
                such as entering certain numbers that the user not allowed to enter and also certain letters, eventually
                all restrictions worked fine.

                    -My suggestion to other developers to make a form for their website is always brainstorm the necessary necessity for a form.
                    Like restricted towns, keywords, and different fonts, and making feilds one at a time to decrease the chances of error and misunderstanding.
                    Then also review each portion of the feild as a user's point of view then review if all the necessary areas are added.Also it is very important to execute
                    each code of block small portion at a time. Lets say if we add the first block as an input pox for first name , we exceute firstname before we move on and create
                    the rest of the blocks. this small information helped to save time and made it easier to debug.
